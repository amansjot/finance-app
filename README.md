Description: Finance analysis tracker for college students to minimize their spendings.

Problem: College students have lots of loans to pay off, but despite this, many are very spendthrift. If students used a tracker, they would better understand how they spend their money and how they can reallocate their spending based on what they need and don’t.

Importance: This problem is important because it is crucial for students to save money so that they don’t regret unnecessary purchases and so that they have money to use to pay off the copious amount of debt they have.

Address: The tracker would help students learn how to better manage their money, which is an essential skill for adulthood. It would also help students save money and learn about how they spend their money through graphs and charts.
