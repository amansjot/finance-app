Description: Finance analysis tracker for college students to record their spending and earning.

Problem: College students have lots of loans to pay off, but despite this, many are very spendthrift. If students used a tracker, they would better understand how they spend their money and how they can reallocate their spending based on what they need and don’t.

Importance: This problem is important because it is crucial for students to save money so that they don’t regret unnecessary purchases and so that they have money to use to pay off the copious amount of debt they have.

Address: The tracker would help students learn how to better manage their money, which is an essential skill for adulthood. It would also help students save money and learn about how they spend their money through graphs and charts.

Usage: In this program, the user is able to record spendings and earnings, view spendings and earnings, and see recommendations for their financial expenditures. The values they input are tracked in a database "expenses" and managed with SQLite. The user can interact with the program using any Command Line Interface (optimized for PyCharm).
